Please refer to [03-react.md](mdc:.guide/fe/code-style/03-react.md) with following rules.

- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Place static content and interfaces at file start.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Minimize 'useEffect', and 'setState'.
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using `_error/{context}-error.tsx` files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.
