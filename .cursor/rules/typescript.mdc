Please refer to [02-typescript.md](mdc:.guide/fe/code-style/02-typescript.md) with following rules.

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps.
- File structure: Reference @03-file-convention.md
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use baseUrl and paths (`"@/*": ["./src/*"]`). Therefore, when importing, use `@/components/...` instead of `./src/...`
However, when using relative paths for files in the same directory, it's fine to use `./...ts`.
